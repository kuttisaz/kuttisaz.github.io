<!--hiii, sazzz <3
   To the beautiful and compassionate human, exhausted from breaking, trying to fit into
  spaces that leave you unheard and didn't see your worth,

  Only you know the full extent of what you faced, so respectively, take this with a grain of salt.
  You will always have me, and with that, a place in my heart, a person to to talk to, and a person 
  you can be yourself around. You can always come to me when your heart is heavy and thoughts are loud.

  You're so admirably brave, the way you look for the light in the overwhelming darkness. The way you 
  fight against all odds when it feels like the walls are closing in on you. 

  Now, I wish to speak not only for me, but everyone you've met, yet never got a chance to 
  express to you how important you are to them, or maybe never got to say goodbye. We hope one day you 
  feel overwhelmed by the love you receive, after all the times you gave much more than you got in 
  return, after all the times your heart ached and you forgot what you're worth. We hope each of your 
  beautiful wishes come true and wonderful things happen to you. You are enough and make this world a 
  better and happier place. You deserve nothing but the best. We're proud of you, and will stand by you 
  till the end and beyond. 
  
  We Love You Sahana, more than all the Galaxies, the Moon, the Sun, and Stars.-->

        <p>To you, Sahana, the most selfless, down to earth (heh), soft-hearted, and 
          emotionally strong person I have ever met,
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>I can't believe our time in class together is coming to an end. 
          From surviving those never-ending lectures to cracking up over the dumbest shit, 
          you've made the whole experience a blast.
        </p>
        <p>Your laid-back vibe and terrible sense of humor have been the highlight of many 
          dull days. Between our unforgettable cranberry juice donuts to the chutti tv vs 
          cbeebies debate on the night before math midterm, no matter what we've done 
          together, every moment spent with you has been pure gold.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>So, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. 
Thank you for being there when I really needed it at my lowest points (even tho 
          I refused to tell you what was bothering my tiny peanut brain most of the time). 
Thank you for dealing with me 
          when I was being pushy and didn't understand the things you were going through, or didn't see things from your shoes. Thank you for making me feel like I had someone to sit next to from the hours long Spotify listen alongs, where your mere presence made me feel so much better. Thank you for existing, 
          and being who you are. Most importantly, thank you ruining my instagram feed with 
          cursed content & TVD quotes. I'll never forget the unexplainable impact you've had on my 
          life, and I'll be forever grateful for our friendship.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>As we go our separate ways, I know we'll both be onto bigger and better things, but that doesn't mean our 
          friendship has an expiration date! Hit me up anytime you want to catch up, reminisce 
          about the good old days, or just shoot the breeze.
        </p>
        <p>Wishing you all the best on your next adventure. Keep being your awesome self, and 
          don't forget to stay in touch. If you ever want to reach out and lose my contact, 
          just search for the nearest Taylor Swift or Harry Styles concert, I'm bound to be
          there with the mad obsession you've driven into me. Just remember, you've got a 
          friend in me no matter where life takes us. I'll pick up the phone even if you call 
          me at 2am and the world is ending. 
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>P.S: Keep me up to date on your album covers and book release (yes im still your 
          personal photographer if when you need one)</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Take care, and stay safe buddy;</p>
        <p>Love you, ennoda loosu thangachi        </p>
